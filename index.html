          ðŸŒ¿Passionate about fashion mindfulness and concerned about the
          environment. Organized and rigorous in my work, I am seeking
          internship opportunities in the field of Knitwear Design and Textile
          Development for my end-of-studies internship of 16-18 weeks starting
          from December/ January'23.<br />
          <br />
          At NIFT, which is my home university in India, I am in my final year
          of Knitwear Design, specializing in sportswear and lingerie. As a
          designer, my work ethic revolves around the belief that mindfulness
          towards oneself and the planet goes hand in hand.<br /><br />
          I completed my exchange semester at ENSAIT on June'22, where I gained
          ample experience in Textile Development and Technology.<br /><br />
          The past year has been filled with new learnings and experiences for
          me as I managed to excel in academics and work life simultaneously. I
          hold work experience with 5 organizations, most recently in the field
          of sustainable design, conceptualization, forecasting, and production
          line operations. <br /><br />Furthermore, I have my artworks published
          in print magazines, and my designs find a home on Social Media, in
          cloth catalogues, and on human bodies (handpoke tattoos).
